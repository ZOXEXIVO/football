# Open Football

[![Build Status](http://drone.zoxexivo.com/api/badges/ZOXEXIVO/open-football/status.svg)](http://drone.zoxexivo.com/ZOXEXIVO/open-football)

Attempt to implement Sigames Football Manager simulation engine without manual control.

**[open-football.org](https://open-football.org)**

The project is a simulation of soccer leagues and clubs, including match simulation.

The project is NOT a game, it is a simulation without the possibility of control.

The goal is to get as close as possible to a real soccer simulation and based on this data:

- Predict match results
- Predict the success of player transfers
  Example: send Kylian Mbapp√© to Italian Bari and run simulation for 5 years and watch results

What do I need to do?
1) Make a simulation of the match
2) Simulate the rest of soccer activities (training, transfers, etc.)
3) Change the synthetic player database to a real one and run the simulation.
4) Use the simulation

Currently available nation for simulation - **Russia**, **Italy**, **England**

#### How to run?

1) Local run

```console
// run frontend (Angular)
cd ui
npm install --force
npm start
...
// run backend
cargo run
...
open chrome at http://localhost:18000
```

2) Run in Docker

```console
cd open-football
docker build -f .\build\Football.Dockerfile -t open-football .
docker run -d -p 18000:18000 --name open-football open-football

open chrome at http://localhost:18000
